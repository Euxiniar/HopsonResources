# OpenGL - Content

**The types of content we want on this list:**

>Just a rough outline, allowances for other content will be allowed on a case by case basis.

_Ranging from beginner to advanced._

- Video tutorials, though these tutorials have to be language agnostic (assuming that     language has OpenGL support) and doesnt require the user to have followed any     other tutorials from that channel before (this includes certain tutorials from people     like thinmatrix, thebennybox, codingmadeeasy etc).
- Stackoverflow works fine, as long as it is strictly OpenGL related 
- Tutorial websites, however I need a reason to why you should use this site over     any other.  (Be objective, please!) 
- OpenGL theory videos (where topics such as PBR might be discussed; but no actual     code is being written. This only goes to a certain point for me though. Not a 1 hour     video with someone explaining how refraction works.) 
- OpenGL papers/books. just like with tutorial websites a reason to why this     book/paper should be used over similar papers/books needs to be specified
- Simple shadertoy shaders (not super advanced ones that use hacks to achive the     effect, as it might not be applicable to real world openGL)
